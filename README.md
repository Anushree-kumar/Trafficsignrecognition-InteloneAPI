## INTRODUCTION 
   In this era of Artificial Intelligence, humans are more dependent on technology. You may be familiar with self-driving cars, where the vehicle itself behaves like a driver and does not need any human guidance to run on the road. This is not wrong to think about the safety aspects—a chance of significant accidents fro multinational companies like Google, Tesla, Uber, Ford, Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and many more are working on automating vehicles. <br>
   
   In order to drive safely, you must abide by different traffic signs, such as traffic lights, turn left or right, speed restrictions, no passing of heavy vehicles, no entrance, children crossing, etc. Similarly, in order to reach accuracy, autonomous vehicles must comprehend these indicators and make choices. Traffic signs classification is a way for identifying the class to which a traffic sign belongs. <br>
  
   
 ### PROBLEM STATEMENT  
   To improve road safety and providing drivers or automatic driving systems with real time information and warnings about the road ahead
   
### OBJECTIVE 
   Objective of proposed solution is to assist drivers or automatic driving systems in detecting and recognizing traffic signs effectively.
   
### SOLUTION 
 The solution of this it to highlight the importance of traffic signs recognition for improving road safety and prevent accidents and it also provide the insights of the real world application.

# THE INTEL ONE API EDGE

### TOOLKIT USED : Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) - Python 3 (Intel® oneAPI 2023.0)
We have utilized the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit to optimize our model and achieve superior results. This toolkit can be used to 'Accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines using Python* tools and frameworks'. Our project uses state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow which are optimized for the Intel architecture by the oneAPI platform. Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-Learn is also enabled to improve performance. The toolkit also supports several pre-trained models such as ResNet, YOLOv3, etc. By using this toolkit we can deliver high performance. Transfer learning with pre-trained models on Intel DevCloud for oneAPI has boosted our Traffic signs recognition method to prevent accidents. The detection part of the safety gear is performed on Intel DevCloud.
